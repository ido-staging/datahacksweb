                DataHack 2015 is the first data-oriented hackathon in Israel, designed to bring together the Israeli data community.     
                <br/>
                The hackathon is a 48-hour event where data-enthusiastic programmers, designers and researchers combine their skills to build innovative solutions for real-world problems. 
                <br/>
                Registration is open to all, but applications will be carefully reviewed for skills and experience. Participants will have complete freedom selecting data, tools, and project ideas.
